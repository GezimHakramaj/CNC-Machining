--Task--

Create a 4" long, 0.5" wide, 1" deep line on a wooden material. The end mill diameter is 1/8". 
The mill is to move 0.0625" horizontally at a time. It can cut 0.03" at a time. Code compensates
for the diameter of the tool manually without using any code in the program. The mill starts at 
X 1 Y 0.5. The length of the line will be from X value 0.9375 to X value 3.9375 but will be coded to go from 
X value 1 to X value 3.875. The same goes for the Y values. It will go from Y value 0.4375 to Y value 0.9375 
but will be moving from Y value 0.5 to Y value 0.875. This is designed to compensate for the extra 1/16" the 
radii create while cutting the material.
