We are using the down-milling approach when it comes to this program. Therefore to ensure feeding the material 
the same direction as the spindle spinning we clear the material every time we reach our end point on the X axis.

I have created this program with comepensation for the diameter of the tool manually rather than using G41/42.
When the machine starts it decline on the Z axis, from our starting point it will create a hole 1/8 in diameter spanning 
from X 0.9375 to X 1.0625 and Y 0.4375 to Y .5625. To compensate for the tools diameter manually we programmed the machine
to stop at X 3.875 which will leave an excess of 1/16 making the vertical cut line span from X 0.9375 to X 3.9375 satisfying 
the 4" long requirement. The same goes with the Y value. We programmed it to stop at Y 0.875 which will leave an excess of 1/16
making the width span from Y 0.4375 to Y .9375 satisfying the 0.5" width. We then execute this process in while loops to satisfy
the 1" deep requirement. Creating a 4" long 0.5" wide and 1" deep line.


// N05 - Creating the tool with a radius of 1/16th of an inch (0.0625).
// N10 - Selecting the tool.
// N15 - Create variable named <_depthOfZ> and assign it a value of 1. 

This variable will be determining the height of where we are cutting throughout the program.

// N20 - Assign a second variable name 2 and assign it a value of 0. 

This variable will be handling the last while loop to cut the remaining 0.01 inch on the Z axis.

// N25 - Set a feedrate if 10 (simulation purposes)
// N30 - Rapid move to X 1
// N35 - Rapid move to Y 0.5 

This will be our starting point.

// N40 - Set incremental distance mode.
// N45 - BEGINNING of a sub-routine ( o100 )
// N50 - Declaring #1 as a local variable with value of 0 which we be reset each time the sub-routine is called that will handle the while loop.
// N55 - Beginning of cutting. G1 linear movement. Moving the Z -0.03"
// N60 - BEGINNING of while loop ( o101 ) with #1 < 6 as its condition.
// N65 - Incrementing the X value by 3.875
// N70 - Incrementing the Z value by <_depthOfZ> multiplied by 0.03 (in this first execution will be 1 * 0.03)

The mill begins cutting at Z -0.03" After N70 the machine increments by + 0.03" to move back to Z 0.

// N75 - Incrementing the X value -3.875 to reset the X-pos back to X 1.
// N80 - Incrementing the Z value by <_depthOfZ> mutliply by -0.03 (in this first execution it will be 1 * -0.03)

N70 and N80 are done so after the vertical cut the machine sets the Z to 0.03 above where it is cutting at 
any given time dynamically with <_depthOfZ> which will be incremented by 1 each time during N135 ( o103 while loop )
- N150 ( end of o103 ). Basically each time the machine cuts a line it will move up by + 0.03 to clear the material 
while resetting the X back to 1 to then move back down to the material to repeat the process. We intend this to 
ensure the safety of the tool and to ensure we are only cutting in a downmilling approach.

// N85 - Increment the Y value by 0.0625
// N90 - Increment the #1 variable by 1.
// N95 - END of while loop ( o101 )
// N100 - Increment the X value by 3.875
// N105 - Increment the Z value by <_depthOfZ> * 0.03
// N110 - Set absoulte distance mode.
// N115 - Reposition the machine to starting point values. X 1 Y 0.5
// N120 - Set incremental distance mode.
// N125 - Increment the Z value by <_depthOfZ> * -0.03
// N130 - END of sub-routine. ( o100 )
// N135 - BEGINNING of while loop ( o103 ) while <_depthOfZ <= 33 as its condition.
// N140 - Call o100 subrouting to be executed.
// N145 - Incrementing <_depthOfZ> by 1
// N150 - END of while loop ( o103 )

At this point when the while loop ends we are still 0.01" shy of the 1" deep requirement.

// N155 - (Still in incremental mode) Increment the Z value by -0.01 
// N160 - BEGINNING of while loop ( o104 ) with #2 < 6 as its condition.

This while loop is a repeat of o101 with the only difference being -0.01 as its target Z.

// N165 - Increment the X value by 3.875
// N170 - Increment the Z value by 0.01
// N175 - Increment the X value by -3.875
// N180 - Increment the Z value by -0.01
// N185 - Increment the Y value by 0.0625
// N190 - Increment #2 by 1.
// N195 - End of while loop ( o104 )
// N200 - Increment the X value by 3.875 

N200 cuts the last vertical line achieving the proper dimensions of our task.

// N205 - Select absolute distance mode.
// N210 - Initiate G0 command. Move to Z 0.
// N215 - Move to X 0 Y 0.
// N220 - END of program.
